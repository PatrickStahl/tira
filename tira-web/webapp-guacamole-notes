The Guacamole part of the webapp consists of ConnectServlet.java and HTTPTunnelServlet.
Additionaly, the mustache files: tira-remote-config, tira-remote-config-rdp and tira-task-user-rdp-body.
The mustache files define the configuration interface and include the client side javascript part of the application.

requirements: a folder and file on the nfs host:
			  e.g. /mnt/nfs/tira/model/guacamole-hosts/guacamole-hosts.txt

			  Here are the guacamole tunnel servers saved in the form: <ip>:<port>

In case of low performance, one can just launch an new server instance with the official docker container:
	docker run -d -p 4822:4822 glyptodon/guacd

and add the entry in the guacamole-hosts.txt on the fly
